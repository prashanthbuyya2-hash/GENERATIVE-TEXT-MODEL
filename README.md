A Generative Text Model is a type of artificial intelligence system designed to generate human-like text based on a given input. These models are trained on large datasets containing text from books, articles, websites, and other sources. By learning patterns in language, grammar, and context, the model can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, complete sentences or paragraphs, summarize content, translate languages, and even create stories or code.
